  "directive": "Add five missing specifications identified by the super overseer for Terraform configuration and Go module definition.\n\n**Issue 1: Missing Terraform Outputs (Checklist Items 71, 74)**\n\nIn section 8.2 (Terraform Output Definitions), add two missing outputs that are needed for deployment scripts and CLI operations:\n\n**Current outputs:**\n- lambda_function_arn\n- api_gateway_url (conditional)\n- step_function_arn (conditional)\n\n**Add these outputs:**\n\n```hcl\noutput \"ecr_repository_url\" {\n  description = \"ECR repository URL for Docker image push operations\"\n  value       = aws_ecr_repository.main.repository_url\n}\n\noutput \"lambda_function_name\" {\n  description = \"Lambda function name for AWS CLI convenience commands\"\n  value       = aws_lambda_function.main.function_name\n}\n```\n\n**Why these are needed:**\n- `ecr_repository_url`: The deployment script (deploy.sh) needs this URL to push Docker images to ECR. Without this output, the script would need to manually construct the URL or query AWS.\n- `lambda_function_name`: Convenient for CLI operations like `aws lambda invoke`, testing, and debugging. Makes it easy to reference the function without looking up the full ARN.\n\n**Issue 2: Missing Lambda Configuration Variables (Checklist Items 72, 73)**\n\nIn section 8.1 (Terraform Variable Definitions), add two missing Lambda configuration variables:\n\n**Add these variables:**\n\n```hcl\nvariable \"lambda_memory\" {\n  description = \"Lambda function memory allocation in MB (128-10240)\"\n  type        = number\n  default     = 512\n}\n\nvariable \"lambda_timeout\" {\n  description = \"Lambda function timeout in seconds (1-900)\"\n  type        = number\n  default     = 30\n}\n```\n\n**Why these are needed:**\n- `lambda_memory`: Allows users to configure Lambda memory based on their workload. Default 512 MB is reasonable for most starter use cases but should be configurable.\n- `lambda_timeout`: Allows users to configure timeout. Default 30 seconds handles Step Functions iterations with delays, but should be configurable for different use cases.\n\n**Issue 3: Missing go.mod Specification (Checklist Item 75)**\n\nThe architecture document mentions Go 1.23+ and dependency versions in section 2.4, but does not provide the actual `go.mod` file content. This is needed for implementation.\n\nAdd a new section 1.3 \"Go Module Definition\" under \"Package Overview\" with the complete `go.mod` file:\n\n```go\nmodule github.com/prethora/starter_golang_aws_lambda\n\ngo 1.23\n\nrequire (\n\tgithub.com/aws/aws-lambda-go v1.51.2\n)\n```\n\n**Note for testing dependencies:**\n\nThe E2E tests will also require (as dev dependencies):\n```go\nrequire (\n\t// Test-only dependencies (not included in Lambda binary)\n\tgithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2 v1.41.1\n\tgithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config v1.28.6\n\tgithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/lambda v1.68.4\n\tgithub.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sfn v1.34.7\n)\n```\n\nHowever, the main go.mod should show only the runtime dependency. Test dependencies will be added when running `go mod tidy` after writing E2E tests.\n\n**Documentation Updates:**\n\nUpdate section 8.2 to include the two new outputs in the table of outputs.\n\nUpdate section 8.1 to include the two new variables in the variable listing, maintaining alphabetical or logical order (configuration variables together).\n\nAdd section 1.3 with the go.mod content immediately after section 1.2 (Build Requirements).",
